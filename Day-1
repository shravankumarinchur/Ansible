WHY use ansible??

1.Less time consuming and more efficient

We can do lot of stuff using ansible like from basic OS tasks
to something like "CLOUD PROVISIONING"

+like day to-day tasks like taking backup , patching and upgrading the server

+Ansible is agentless, meaning we do not have to install anything on the target server

Some examples:
1.Installing docker on 100's of server
2.checking the service status


HOW ansible Works
-----------------

1.Write the playbook(yaml file) we'll mention all the tasks in the book
2.We can run this from the client machine (laptop) and we can reuse the yaml to rerun on different server's
3.This way, it is more relialble and less prone to errors


Detailed Working
----------------
Ansible architecture includes "modules"

+Modules are small piece of small that does the task
+Modules are very granular and perform light-weight task for example:- There are modules to install package, and to start service amd etc..
+Modules are pushed to target server and performs it's task and gets removed once done!
